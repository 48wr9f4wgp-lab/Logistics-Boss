# Logistics Boss Benchmark Pack — 2026-09-13

Status: Live benchmark refresh before major design pass
Scope: 3D observer management / logistics / automation / mobile-first interaction
Canonical rule: GAME_DEV_MASTER_RULES v1.3

## Selection logic
Final benchmark set is deliberately multi-source. We extract transferable principles, not layouts, copy, characters, iconography or branded content.

## Final benchmark pack

### 1. Factorio
Why benchmark: automation, visible throughput, bottleneck diagnosis, progressive replacement of manual work, programmable rules.
Adopt:
- production-flow readability
- throughput as a primary metric
- automation rules that can react to thresholds
- milestone-driven unlocks
- upgrades that change the operating model, not only numeric output
Avoid:
- desktop-density UI
- recipe explosion in the vertical slice

### 2. Timberborn
Why benchmark: autonomous workers, workplace priorities, status warnings, visible logistics, 3D observer play.
Adopt:
- per-workstream priority control
- explicit staffing / queue warnings
- worker assignment should be understandable from the world view
- expansion from manual labor to automation
- bottleneck diagnosis before raw content growth
Avoid:
- deep survival/needs simulation before logistics loop proves fun

### 3. Against the Storm
Why benchmark: short strategic runs, orders with choices, perks that alter strategy, readable pressure and risk.
Adopt:
- choose-one-of-several contracts
- timed and non-timed operational objectives
- rewards that alter strategy rather than only add cash
- rising operational pressure that creates decisions
Avoid:
- roguelite meta complexity until the basic session loop proves retention

### 4. shapez 2
Why benchmark: pure visual automation, low-stress optimization, milestones, satisfying improvement of reusable systems.
Adopt:
- clean visual flow
- clear milestones
- no need for combat or forced failure to create challenge
- progressive automation layers
- success should be visible in the facility itself
Avoid:
- large multi-layer factory construction in the first mobile slice

### 5. Mini Motorways
Why benchmark: mobile-native management, emergent congestion, minimal input, clear failure/bottleneck language, time controls.
Adopt:
- simple touch interaction
- congestion emerges from demand instead of arbitrary timers
- pause / 1x / 2x / 4x
- one glance should reveal what is going wrong
- milestones can present constrained upgrade choices
Avoid:
- irreversible collapse with no recovery path in the main mode

## Secondary references

### Oxygen Not Included
Use for: diagnostic overlays, task priority language, system-status visibility, autonomous-agent observability.

### Two Point Museum
Use for: staff personality/traits, side expeditions, collection/meta progression, readable staff action states, playful incidents.

### Satisfactory
Use for: visual automation spectacle, conveyors as reward, facility growth that becomes impressive to watch.

### Idle Office Tycoon / mobile idle-tycoon pattern
Use for: compact upgrade cards, milestone rewards, strong sense of economic escalation. Do not import ad/IAP pressure or passive waiting as core play.

## Strong conventions found across 3+ benchmarks
1. Autonomous agents/machines execute the plan; the player changes policy, layout or priorities.
2. Bottlenecks are the content: queues, shortages, capacity and travel time should be legible.
3. Time controls are mandatory for observer management.
4. Upgrade effects must visibly change flow.
5. The player needs a clear next objective/milestone.
6. Automation should replace tedious manual work over time.
7. Problems should be recoverable; failure should teach what to change.
8. Information layers/overlays are important once the system becomes dense.

## Adopted for Logistics Boss vertical slice
### A. Fine-grained work priorities
Store / Pick-Pack / Ship each gain a 1–5 priority in addition to high-level policies.

### B. Contract board
Offer 3 operational contracts. Player picks one. Examples:
- Ship N parcels before the timer expires
- Keep inbound queue below a threshold for a duration
- Sustain a minimum throughput for a duration
Contracts pay cash and Research Points.

### C. Research / perk choice
Research Points unlock one of several lightweight operating perks. Perks are generic and stack-limited.

### D. Bottleneck director
Continuously calculate the dominant bottleneck and show:
- cause
- severity
- recommended action
- station saturation

### E. Diagnostic overlay
Toggle between Normal and Flow view. Flow view shows worker task lines and station saturation colors.

### F. Milestone cadence
Shipment milestones grant research/progression rewards rather than only passive cash.

### G. Recovery-first design
No sudden hard game over in the default mode. Severe congestion reduces efficiency and creates visible chaos, but the player can recover by changing priorities or buying capacity.

## Deferred until the slice proves fun
- full building placement/editor
- multiple SKUs/recipes
- staff needs/moods
- expeditions as a side loop
- randomized incidents/events
- offline earnings
- prestige/reset economy
- complex circuit logic

## Success gate after this pass
The slice is worth expanding only if all are true:
1. Player can identify the bottleneck within 3–5 seconds.
2. A directive/priority change visibly changes behavior within 5 seconds.
3. First contract can complete within the first session.
4. First upgrade changes throughput measurably.
5. Watching the autonomous facility is entertaining without constant tapping.
